### Improvement Plans

#### Backend

- Implement a better API with pagination.
- Utilize the asset class API to create dynamic filter buttons.
- Write additional unit and integration tests for API endpoints.
- Use a more scalable database for production, such as PostgreSQL.
- Implement centralized error handling across the application.
- Add proper error code handling for more meaningful responses.
- Containerize the backend using Docker for easier deployment.

#### Frontend

- Improve user error handling for better user experience.
- Add pagination to handle large datasets more effectively.
- Optimize API calls to reduce load times and improve performance.
- Write tests for components and API integration to ensure stability.
- Containerize the frontend using Docker for easier deployment.
